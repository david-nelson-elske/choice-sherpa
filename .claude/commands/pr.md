# PR - Create Pull Request

Create a pull request with proper formatting. Can generate from feature file or commits.

## Usage
```
/pr [options]
/pr --from-feature features/user-auth.md
/pr --draft
```

## Options
- `--from-feature <file>`: Generate PR from feature file
- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--no-push`: Don't push, just show PR preview
- `--base <branch>`: Target branch (default: main)

---

## Prerequisites

Before creating PR, verify all checks pass:

### 1. Tests Pass
```bash
/test
```

### 2. Lint Passes
```bash
/lint
```

### 3. Security Review Passes
```bash
/security-review --pr
```

**Required**: No CRITICAL or HIGH severity findings allowed.

### 4. Code Simplification Review
```bash
/code-simplifier
```

Review code for unnecessary complexity and suggest simplifications.

### 5. Branch is Up to Date
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

### 6. Changes are Committed
```bash
git status  # Should be clean
```

---

## Process

### Step 1: Run Verification

```bash
# Run full check suite
/lint && /test && /security-review --pr && /code-simplifier
```

All four must pass before PR creation:
- **Lint**: Code style and quality
- **Test**: Functionality verification
- **Security**: No CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities
- **Simplify**: No unnecessary complexity

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

```
📊 PR Analysis

Branch: feat/user-auth → main
Commits: 5
Files changed: 8
Lines: +324, -12

Changes by type:
  src/         6 files  (+280, -10)
  tests/       2 files  (+44, -2)
```

### Step 3: Generate PR Content

**From Feature File (`--from-feature`):**

Reads the feature file to generate:
- Title from `# Feature:` heading
- Summary from description/blockquote
- Task list from `## Tasks` checkboxes
- Checklist from `## Acceptance Criteria`

**From Commits (default):**

- Title from branch name: `feat/user-auth` → `[user-auth] Feature implementation`
- Body from commit messages

### Step 4: Create PR

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "[user-auth] User Authentication" \
  --body "$(cat pr-body.md)" \
  --base main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "gh: command not found"

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
sudo apt install gh

# Then authenticate
gh auth login
```

### PR Creation Fails

```bash
# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Check remote
git remote -v

# Push branch first if needed
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### CI Fails After PR

1. Check CI logs in GitHub
2. Fix issues locally
3. Push fixes: `git push`
4. CI will re-run automatically
