### 2. Typography
We need fonts that are highly legible (for complex decision-making) but modern.

*   **Primary Font (Headings): Poppins**
    *   A geometric sans-serif that is friendly, open, and structured. Use bold weights for impact.
*   **Secondary Font (Body Copy): Inter**
    *   Clean, tall, and incredibly easy to read on screens. It handles complex information well.

### 3. Asset Descriptions & Generation Prompts

Here are the visual descriptions of the assets. Use the accompanying prompts in your preferred AI image generator.

#### A. Primary Logo: The "Geometric Guide"
**Description:** A combination mark (icon + text). The icon is a stylized head of a llama in profile, looking right (forward/future). The llama is constructed from geometric shapes, giving it a digital/structured feel. The "wool" texture on its neck subtly forms three ascending mountain peaks. The overall shape feels like a shield or a badge of confidence.

*   **Icon Colors:** Sherpa Blue and Cyan Ascent.
*   **Text:** "Choice Sherpa" in Poppins Bold, to the right of the icon.

> **AI Image Prompt for Logo:**
> A modern, geometric logo for a tech company called "Choice Sherpa". The icon is a stylized llama head in profile looking right, constructed from interlocking blue and cyan geometric shapes. The neck fur of the llama subtly forms three ascending mountain peaks. To the right of the icon, the words "Choice Sherpa" in a bold, dark blue, sans-serif font. Flat design, vector illustration style, clean lines, white background. --v 6.0 (if using Midjourney)

#### B. The Favicon (Browser Tab Icon)
**Description:** This needs to be simple and recognizable at tiny sizes. We will isolate just the head/mountain element from the main logo, removing the text.

> **AI Image Prompt for Favicon:**
> A flat vector app icon. A stylized, geometric llama head in profile, constructed from dark blue and cyan shapes, where the neck fur forms mountain peaks. No text. Isolated on a white circle background. Simple, clean, modern.

#### C. Website Hero Graphic Concept
**Description:** This would be the main image on your homepage. It illustrates the "before and after" of using your service.

On the left (the "messy tradeoffs"), there is a tangled knot of ropes and confused, grey question marks hovering over a foggy, jagged path. On the right, a friendly, stylized llama (the AI agent) wearing a small backpack is calmly leading a human figure up a clear, bright, structured path made of glowing cyan stepping stones toward a sunlit mountain peak.

> **AI Image Prompt for Hero Image:**
> A website illustration showing a journey from confusion to clarity. On the left side, a dark, foggy, tangled path with knots and grey question marks. On the right side, a bright, sunny, stylized mountain peak. A friendly, geometric llama character with a small backpack is leading a person up a clear, glowing cyan path made of structured steps toward the summit. The art style is modern tech illustration, isometric view, blue, cyan, and gold color palette.

#### D. The "Agent" Avatar
**Description:** Since your service uses "agents" to walk users through steps, you need a small avatar to represent the AI in the chat interface.

> **AI Image Prompt for Agent Avatar:**
> A circular profile icon of a friendly AI agent. A minimalist illustration of the geometric llama head from the main logo, wearing a small, high-tech headset with a glowing cyan microphone. The background of the circle is a soft Sherpa blue gradient. Friendly and helpful expression.
